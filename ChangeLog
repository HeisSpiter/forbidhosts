    * ForbidHostsv6.cpp: Fix a bug with syslog output
    * ForbidHostsv6.cpp: Add new functions and associated macros to have asserts that write their result to syslog.
      Those assert can be either soft or hard, if hard the deamon quits.
    * ForbidHostsv6.cpp: Use them instead of ignoring the return of some functions.
