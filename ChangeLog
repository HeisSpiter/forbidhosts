    * ForbidHosts.cpp: Don't prune host entry while it is being written to hosts.deny. This fixes the bug when a host was added several times to the file.
      Now hosts will be pruned later on, on their expiry time, which will be extended to prevent the host is prunned before it was properly and completely handled.
      This allows changing the way hosts are handled when added to hosts.deny that will give a small boost in performances.
