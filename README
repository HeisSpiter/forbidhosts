ForbidHostsv6 is a tool that has been designed to run with DenyHosts on IPv6 enabled systems. While DenyHosts will catch IPv4 connections on SSH, ForbidHostsv6 only focuses on IPv6 connections.

Its behaviour is simple. Once too many connections attempts have been detected, it simply adds the IP in /etc/hosts.deny and mails root.

ForbidHostsv6 does not take any argument. Run it, it will fork in background. Kill it with signals.

This has been specifically designed for the ReactOS Foundation infrastructure, but we are open to suggestions and patches :-).

Starting on the 26-Aug-2014, support for IPv4 was added (optional though) because Ubuntu dropped DenyHosts in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. The features for IPv4 and IPv6 are exactly the same.
